# DriftPower 

#### DriftPower is an script that provides a better driving experience on Grand Theft Auto V, specially to tose that like sim-cade games that are fun but challenging. 

#### For a complete experience, I strongly recommend to use this along my driving camera mod [CustomCamera V Plus](https://github.com/Rbn3D/CustomCameraVPlus)



### How it works

DriftPower modifies several handling parameters on real-time (as you drive). Is meant to work out of the box. It does not require setup or fine-tuning. Instead, a general set of options allows to alter physics behaviour in-game. These options affects the behaviour of each vehicle differently, depending on their original handling parameters.


### NOT a physically correct mod

DriftPower is not meant to bring physically correct driving physics to be game. It's just an experiment that somehow enhances driving experience. Doing it was fun, and I think playing it should be fun too... :)


### Requirements

* A copy of GTA V for PC
* Script Hook V .Net (https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet)


### Install

Expect binary releases and simple install instructions soon... (But, in case you don't mind to get your hands dirty, just clone the repo and compile using VS 2022, the .asi goes to the 'scripts' folder) 


### Acknowledgements

Rockstar for making GTA V and allow single player mods on it.
Eddlm for his InverseTorque mod, which my mod was initially based on.
